# Lab 3: Getting a Connector via the Microsoft Security Store​

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore the Microsoft Security Store and learn how to deploy a pre-built security solution that integrates with Microsoft Sentinel. The goal is to understand how security content, such as analytics rules, workbooks, hunting queries, and connectors, can be deployed and managed directly from the Security Store. You will deploy the Microsoft Defender XDR solution for Sentinel, which streamlines integration between Defender XDR and Sentinel by automatically adding relevant data connectors, detections, and dashboards. This process demonstrates how organizations can accelerate threat detection and response by using ready-made security solutions instead of building everything manually.

### Objectives
